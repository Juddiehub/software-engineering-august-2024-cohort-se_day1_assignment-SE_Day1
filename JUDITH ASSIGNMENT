Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users.
Software engineering is transforming the modern business landscape by providing organizations with the capacity to rapidly upscale their IT infrastructure and develop high-quality, reliable software solutions, thereby enhancing operations, optimizing processes, and driving greater efficiency
First off, what are milestones in the context of software development? You can find a more detailed explanation here, but the basic idea is that at the beginning of a project you break up the anticipated work into a series of steps and set deadlines for each step. Each completed step is a “milestone”.
